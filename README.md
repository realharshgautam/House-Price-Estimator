## Introduction

Real-Estate Price Predictor is a machine learning project developed to assist users in estimating the price of real estate properties based on various features such as location, size, amenities, etc. The project utilizes supervised learning algorithms to train models on historical real-estate data and predicts prices for new properties.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of historical real-estate data containing information about properties such as size, location, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, amenities, and sale prices.

## Features

The features used for predicting real-estate prices include:
- Size of the property (in square feet)
- Location (latitude and longitude)
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms
- Amenities (swimming pool, garden, garage, etc.)
- Distance to amenities (schools, hospitals, supermarkets, etc.)

## Models

The project utilizes various machine learning models for predicting real-estate prices, including:
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Support Vector Regression
- Neural Networks

## Evaluation

The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) score to assess their accuracy in predicting real-estate prices.

## Usage

To use the Real-Estate Price Predictor:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Preprocess the dataset and train the machine learning models using the provided scripts.
4. Use the trained models to predict real-estate prices for new properties.
5. Evaluate the performance of the models using the provided evaluation metrics.
